# Muse
A python script that generates a random melody and harmony using the pentatonic scale. The result should be soothing background music.

To run:
- `python3 muse.py`
- This should be all. A file called "soothing music" will be generated and played by Pygame.

TO DO:
- Key changes (currently only in Amaj/F#min)
- GUI
- Other instruments/tracks
